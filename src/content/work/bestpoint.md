## Project Overview

**Repository:** [github.com/razaq-himawan/bestpoint](https://github.com/razaq-himawan/bestpoint)

BestPoint is a directory listing application where I served as the Backend Engineer. The goal was to build a robust API capable of handling complex relationships between users, listings, and reviews.

## Technical Highlights

- **Scalable Architecture:** Engineered a RESTful API using **Express.js** and **MongoDB** designed for high-volume data retrieval.
- **Data Modeling:** Implemented complex data modeling with **Mongoose** to efficiently handle relationships (Users <-> Listings <-> Reviews), adhering to strict MVC design patterns.
- **Security:** Integrated secure authentication protocols using **Passport.js** and **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to ensure robust data protection for user accounts.

## Key Outcomes

Successfully delivered a backend system that supports secure user authentication and complex data querying, serving as the foundation for the frontend client.
