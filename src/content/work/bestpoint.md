This project, BestPoint, is a full-stack web application inspired by Yelp. It was built as part of the CodePolitan Studi Kasus: Aplikasi Directory Listing dengan Express.js dan MongoDB. The goal was to create a directory listing platform where users can explore different places and leave review.

The app covers the entire development flow: from setting up an Express.js server and designing the database with MongoDB, to integrating HERE Maps for geolocation and building secure authentication with Passport.js. On the frontend, it uses EJS for templating and Bootstrap for a responsive UI, making it simple and functional for users to navigate.

### 🚀 Features

- ✅ Create, read, update, and delete places (CRUD functionality)
- 📍 Map integration using HERE Maps
- 🧾 Leave and manage reviews for each place
- 👤 User authentication and authorization
- 🔒 Secure routes and form validation

- **MongoDB** & **Mongoose** – Database and ODM
- **EJS** – Templating engine
