This project is a simple **tic-tac-toe game** built as part of _The Odin Project_ JavaScript curriculum. The goal was to practice JavaScript fundamentals while applying concepts like modular code structure, DOM manipulation, and event handling to build an interactive game.

The game allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the grid, with win detection and draw conditions implemented. The UI is styled with basic CSS for clarity and responsiveness, keeping the focus on functionality and clean code.

Through this project, I reinforced the importance of separating game logic from UI rendering, making the code easier to test and maintain. It also gave me practice in managing state and updating the DOM dynamically based on user actions.
